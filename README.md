# Network Monitoring & Alerting Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates core network monitoring and alerting concepts used in enterprise and service provider environments.  
The lab focuses on visibility, performance monitoring, alert thresholds, and incident response workflows that support network reliability and uptime.

---

## Objectives
- Monitor network devices and links using SNMP and ICMP
- Track key performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and availability
- Define alert thresholds and escalation conditions
- Demonstrate structured incident detection and response
- Document monitoring logic in a clear, operational manner

---

## Monitoring Scope
This lab focuses on monitoring the following components:

- Network devices (routers and switches)
- Interfaces and link health
- Latency and packet loss
- Device availability and uptime
- Performance trends and anomalies

Monitoring concepts are designed to reflect real-world NOC and operations workflows.

---

## Technologies & Concepts
- **Monitoring Protocols:** SNMP polling, ICMP
- **Metrics:** Latency, packet loss, availability, interface utilization
- **Alerting:** Threshold-based alerts, escalation conditions
- **Troubleshooting:** Correlating alerts with network symptoms
- **Tools & Concepts:** SolarWinds-style monitoring, syslog concepts

---

## Operational Workflow
The monitoring workflow follows these stages:

1. Continuous polling and health checks
2. Detection of abnormal conditions
3. Alert generation based on thresholds
4. Engineer investigation and validation
5. Root cause identification and resolution
6. Post-incident review and documentation

## Zero Trust and Monitoring

Continuous monitoring supports a Zero Trust model by providing visibility into network behavior
across segmented environments. Latency, packet loss, and availability metrics help detect anomalies
that may indicate misconfiguration, failure, or potential security issues.

Monitoring reinforces the principle of continuous verification rather than assumed trust.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network observability and monitoring strategy
- Alert fatigue avoidance through meaningful thresholds
- Operational awareness and incident response
- Translating monitoring data into actionable insight
- Clear technical documentation

---

## Status
This project is actively being expanded with monitoring scenarios, alert examples, and incident response documentation.
